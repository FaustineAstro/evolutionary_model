        ==================
        
            This package parses the tables provided by France Allard (available at 
            http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/france.allard/ as ascii tables in the folder ISOCHRONES) 
            to be able to derive the property of a planet given another property and the
            age of the star. Typically one would know the luminosity of the planet and 
            one would like to derive the mass assuming a certain age.
            It can also be used reversely to find the luminosity given its mass.
            Several examples of how the tool can be used are given in the __main__ of the 
            module evolutionaryModel.
