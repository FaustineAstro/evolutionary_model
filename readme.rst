Evolutionary Model
==================

This package parses the tables provided by France Allard (available under ISOCHRONES at http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/france.allard/ as ascii tables) to be able to derive the property of a planet (for instance its mass) given another property (for instance its luminosity) and the age of the star. It can also be used conversely to find the luminosity given its mass.
Several examples of how the tool can be used are given in the __main__ of the module evolutionaryModel.
